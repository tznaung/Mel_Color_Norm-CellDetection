# H &amp; E color normalization and Cell Detection Algorithms 
The color normalization algorithm was initially developed using the Mecenko MatLab code, which is instrumental in standardizing color variations across histopathological images. This process addressed discrepancies in stain intensity and hue, ensuring consistent color representation for downstream analysis. The algorithm was then integrated into QuPath, creating a one-click color normalization tool for ease of use and efficiency in large-scale image processing. Once the color normalization was complete, the next step involved developing a cell detection algorithm using these standardized images. This algorithm was designed to identify and classify cells into tumor, immune, stromal, and other cell types. For the data analysis, five distinct types of electronic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes % (eTILs%)—a machine-read method of TIL quantification published in Aung et al., EBioMedicine, 2022 (PMID: 35810563 PMCID: PMC9272337 DOI: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104143)—were integrated into the script. After running the entire algorithm, it becomes possible to calculate the percentage of TILs based on any selected variables.
