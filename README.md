# H &amp; E color normalization and Cell Detection Algorithms 
The color normalization algorithm was initially developed using the Mecenko MatLab code, which is instrumental in standardizing color variations across histopathological images. This process addressed discrepancies in stain intensity and hue, ensuring consistent color representation for downstream analysis. The algorithm was then integrated into QuPath, creating a one-click color normalization tool for ease of use and efficiency in large-scale image processing. Once the color normalization was complete, the next step involved developing a cell detection algorithm using these standardized images.

# Cell Detection Algorithm
The Cell Detection folder contains the cell detection algorithm and an accompanying instruction manual. The cell detection algorithm (Cells_Calculator_ANNSEP24) was trained on color-normalized H&E stained images. This algorithm detects four distinct cell types: tumor cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and other cells within the tissue microenvironment. Integrated into the algorithm is the functionality to calculate five distinct types of electronic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes percentage (eTILs%), following the machine-read method of TIL quantification published in Aung et al., EBioMedicine, 2022 (PMID: 35810563; PMCID: PMC9272337; DOI: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104143). This approach enables the quantification of immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. After running the algorithm, users can calculate the percentage of TILs based on any selected variables, providing flexibility for various types of analyses. The folder also includes comprehensive instructions for applying the Cell Detection algorithm, detailing each stepâ€”from preprocessing images through color normalization to executing cell detection and eTILs% calculation.
